Description: Package for calculating aggregated isotopic distribution
        and exact center-masses for chemical substances (in this
        version composed of C, H, N, O and S). This is an
        implementation of the BRAIN algorithm described in the paper by
        J. Claesen, P. Dittwald, T. Burzykowski and D. Valkenborg.
